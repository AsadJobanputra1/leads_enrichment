# Architecture for Educause Leads Enrichment Service

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and technical design for the Educause Leads Enrichment Service, focusing on system components, interactions, and technology stack.

## Architectural Style

- **Style**: Modular Monolith
  - Justification: Given the simplicity and single-purpose nature of the application, a modular monolith allows for clear separation of concerns while maintaining simplicity in deployment and management.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **OpenAI SDK**: For AI integration
- **CSV Library**: For handling CSV files
- **Environment Management**: Use of environment variables for configuration

## Data Models and Schemas

- **CSV Data Model**: Represents the structure of input and output CSV files.
- **OpenAI Response Model**: Defines the expected structure of responses from OpenAI.

## Key Components

1. **CLI Interface**: Handles user input and displays options.
2. **CSV Processor**: Validates and processes CSV files.
3. **OpenAI Integration**: Manages communication with the OpenAI API.
4. **Data Management**: Handles saving and loading of data files.

## Scalability, Security, and Performance

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large CSV files by processing data in chunks.
- **Security**: OpenAI API keys are stored securely using environment variables.
- **Performance**: Optimized CSV reading and writing to minimize I/O operations.

## Reflection

- The architecture is designed to be simple yet effective for the task at hand.
- Potential bottlenecks include network latency with OpenAI API calls, which can be mitigated by batching requests.
- The choice of a modular monolith allows for easy future refactoring into microservices if needed.
