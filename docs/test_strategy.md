# Test Strategy for Educause Leads Enrichment Service

## Overview

This document outlines the test strategy for the Educause Leads Enrichment Service, focusing on ensuring functionality, reliability, and performance through various testing methods.

## Testing Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Implement tests before writing the corresponding code to ensure all functionalities are covered.
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated test tools to streamline the testing process and ensure consistency.

## Test Cases

### Input Fields

1. **CSV File Input**:
   - Test with valid CSV files.
   - Test with invalid file formats (e.g., .txt, .xlsx).
   - Test with missing or corrupted files.

2. **Command Line Arguments**:
   - Test with valid and invalid command line arguments.
   - Test with missing optional arguments.

### Output Formats

1. **CSV Output**:
   - Verify the structure and content of the output CSV file.
   - Test with large datasets to ensure performance.

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Scenarios

1. **Successful CSV Processing**:
   - Input a valid CSV file and verify the enriched output.

2. **Menu Navigation**:
   - Navigate through the CLI menu and execute commands successfully.

### Failure Cases and Edge Cases

1. **Invalid File Handling**:
   - Attempt to process non-CSV files and expect error messages.

2. **Network Failures**:
   - Simulate network issues during OpenAI API calls and verify error handling.

3. **Large File Processing**:
   - Test with extremely large CSV files to check for performance bottlenecks.

## Test Tools and Dependencies

- **Unit Testing Framework**: Use `unittest` or `pytest` for writing and executing tests.
- **Mocking Library**: Use `unittest.mock` to simulate OpenAI API responses.
- **CSV Validation Tool**: Use a library like `pandas` for validating CSV structures.

## Unit Testing Guidance

- Write unit tests for each function, focusing on both expected and edge cases.
- Use mocking to simulate external dependencies like the OpenAI API.
- Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on external systems or files.

## Reflection

- This test strategy aims to cover all critical aspects of the system, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- Potential challenges include handling asynchronous API calls and large data processing, which can be mitigated through thorough testing and optimization.
